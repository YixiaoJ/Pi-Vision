What is Pi Vision?

	Pi Vision is a Graphical User Interface for the Raspberry Pi Camera.
	It allows you to control the camera functions through the camera's
	native camera apps. It also displays the terminal commands sent. 

	The project was developed using Lazarus FPC and has been released 
	as open source. It is what you make of it.

	The incentive of Pi Vision is to allow for easy use of the 
	Raspberry Pi camera while also serving as an instructional tool. 
	Employed commands are relayed to the user. This assists novice users 
	in understanding the command structure.

	While Pi Vision is specificaly built for the ARM based Raspberry Pi, 
	binaries have also been provided for Windows, OSX and 
	Debian Linux. These are, however, only intended to review the 
	application.

Where is the Install document?

	See the directory named "source" for the install.

Why won't Pi Vision app run on the Raspberry?

	You need to set its Permissions first.

	In order to run your apps independently from the Lazarus IDE you will 
	first need to set permissions. Right-click on the app and select Properties 
	from the drop-down. Select the Permissions tab from the Properties menu.
	There is a small check-box called "Make this file executable". Check this, 
	close the window and click on the app to run it.
