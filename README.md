What is Pi Vision?

	Pi Vision is a Graphical User Interface for the Raspberry Pi Camera.
	It allows you to control the camera functions through the camera's
	native camera apps. It also displays the terminal commands sent. 

	The project was developed using Lazarus FPC and has been released 
	as open source. It is what you make of it.

	The incentive of Pi Vision is to allow for easy use of the 
	Raspberry Pi camera while also serving as an instructional tool. 
	Employed commands are relayed to the user. This assists novice users 
	in understanding the command structure.

	While Pi Vision is specificaly built for the ARM based Raspberry Pi, 
	binairies have also been provided for Windows, OSX and 
	Debian Linux. These are, however, only intended to review the 
	application.
