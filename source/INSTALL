DEVELOPMENT
===========

Pi Vision was specifically built for controlling the camera of the 
ARM based Raspberry Pi. 

However, Pi Vision was developed on Linux Mint 14 using Lazarus Pascal 
and FPC and then re-compiled/built and tested on the Raspberry Pi using 
Lazarus Pascal and FPC.

The reasoning for this approach was to facilitate faster development using
a modern desktop machine. Only the testing, troubleshooting and debugging 
was performed on the Raspberry Pi. 

As Lazarus runs on a plurality of systems it is also possible to 
develop on other systems instead of using Linux Mint. These include:

- Recent version of windows 32/64 bit
- OSX intel
- Linux RH/Deb

In most all cases you will be able to use the supplied source directly and 
without modification.

In addition, cross-compilers exist which further facilitate ease of development.


INSTALL LAZARUS + FPC ON RASPBIAN
=================================

The Internet provides ample information on how to install Lazarus on a 
multitude of systems. Officially for Raspbian:

http://wiki.freepascal.org/Lazarus_on_Raspberry_Pi

A brief overview is provided here regarding installation on the Raspberry Pi 
board B, Raspbian Wheezy.

Lazarus + FPC (Free Pascal Compiler) is already part of the Raspbian 
Repository.

Open a terminal and enter the following commands:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo apt-get install fpc
sudo apt-get install lazarus

This process will take some time to download, unpack and install. After 
installation you will find Lazarus from the "Programming" section of 
the LXDE start menu.

NOTE 1:

This version of Lazarus is not the most recent. More recent version can be 
compiled to run on Raspbian Weezy. But that is beyond this install document. 
In any case this is not needed to compile and run Pi Vision.

NOTE 2:

In order to install Lazarus and its dependencies you will need enough disc 
space. Make sure that the entire SD card that contains the Raspbian image is 
employed. The start menu in Raspbian will display options for this. To open
this menu open a terminal and type in the command:

sudo raspi-config

It is one of the first options called:

expand_rootfs Expand root partition to fill SD card

You will need to do this prior to installing Lazarus.

PROJECT SOURCES
===============

Start LXDE on the Raspberry.

startx

Create a directory in a desired location on your Raspberry. Place all source 
files and directories in this directory. Pi Vision's Lazarus project file 
is called:

rpiCC.lpr

Double click this file. Lazarus is typically already associated with its native 
files and will open automatically. It may take a moment or two to start Lazarus.

If Lazarus does not start automatically after clicking the .lpr file go to the 
Programming section, start Lazarus and open the .lpr file from the Lazarus IDE.

With the project opened go to "Run" in the main menu and select "Build". Then 
select Run once this completes or the F9 key. It may take up to two minutes 
for Pi Vision to run.

If you have setup your camera correctly you will be able to directly use 
Pi Vision to control it.
